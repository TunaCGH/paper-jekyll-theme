## Project Introduction
Objective
This project aims to build a system that detects employee attention levels based on input from a webcam or surveillance camera. The system distinguishes between:

- Open eyes – indicating alertness.

- Closed eyes – possibly sleepy or inattentive.

- Only hair visible – the person is likely resting their head on the desk (asleep).


Motivation

- In both remote and on-site work environments, monitoring focus and attention is crucial.

- This solution allows managers to gauge employee engagement non-invasively, without the need for constant supervision.

- It can also be applied in online classrooms or e-learning platforms.

## Problem Statement

- Input: Images or video frames from a webcam or fixed camera.

- Output: A label classifying the person’s state as either open eyes, closed eyes, or only hair.

# Challenges

- Real-world variations such as different head angles, lighting conditions, obstructions (e.g., hair, glasses, masks).

- The model needs to be sensitive enough to make accurate predictions but also robust to noise.

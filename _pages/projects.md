# Project Introduction
Objective
This project aims to build a system that detects employee attention levels based on input from a webcam or surveillance camera. The system distinguishes between:

-Open eyes – indicating alertness.

-Closed eyes – possibly sleepy or inattentive.

-Only hair visible – the person is likely resting their head on the desk (asleep).


Motivation

-In both remote and on-site work environments, monitoring focus and attention is crucial.

-This solution allows managers to gauge employee engagement non-invasively, without the need for constant supervision.

-It can also be applied in online classrooms or e-learning platforms.
